Specifically, we are interested in looking at the spillover impact on cardiovascular care due to the COVID-19 pandemic public health countermeasures from March 2020, such as the slow-down of scheduled surgeries and procedures. Our goal is to reduce the cardiovascular health consequences of the current and subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing up-to-date data from across Canada to health care providers, administrators and policy makers. Data is provided by national (CIHI) and provincial data custodians and will be updated every three months. We have focused on the cardiovascular admissions and procedures, reported per week, also reported at national and provincial (where possible) levels. To understand the severity of the cases, we also report the average length of stay per admission/procedure/week and the mean deaths/100 cases. The outcomes are reported only at a national level.\nInterpretation\nFrom March 2020, there was a substantial reduction in all CV procedures and admissions. There is no signal on the current data that outcomes were worse for the admissions and procedures performed. We anticipate having patient wait-list data soon.\nData is updated as new “open data” is available from CIHI and other jurisdictional data sources. The open data will be updated every 3 months and may reflect under-reporting from individual institutions.\nAll counts with < 5 people is suppressed as per privacy regulations.\nCOVID-19 statistics are provided by Johns Hopkins University. Last updated on Mon Dec 07 2020 08:01:42 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time).\nThe start of the COVID-19 pandemic is marked with a red line (the 10th week of 2020).",

CCS considers that a conflict of interest exists when the reviewers personal, professional or financial interests affect, or may be perceived to affect, their objectivity. Potential reviewers will recuse themselves from the review where a COI exists or may appear to exist. These policies have been developed by CCS to ensure the effective management of real or perceived conflicts of interest in the review process to ultimately encourage a culture of trust and transparency in the research funding process.\nReview of Applications\nScientific Review Committee\nThe Award review committees are volunteer committees. Each peer-review committee member has demonstrated scientific expertise in cardiovascular disease. Appointment of committee members takes into consideration required expertise, regional distribution, gender, and language skills to ensure a fair and balanced review process. Members are appointed for a three-year term. All recipients of CCS Awards are committed to serving at least a one-year term as a peer reviewer.\nAny reviewer who is a Co-Applicant or Collaborator on an CCS Award application may not be present when their application is being assessed and must recuse themselves from the discussion. Applications are reviewed by two committee members and, whenever deemed appropriate by the Co-Chairs, and an additional reader, when expertise is required. Each reviewer conducts a written review and rates the application based on the Peer-Review Criteria in Eligibility and Assessment Criteria. Scientific reviewers are assigned to applications based on their area of expertise, and with consideration of any real or perceived conflicts of interest. Prior to the committee meeting, reviewers will submit their scores to CCS via the on-line platform. After a panel discussion, a consensus rating will be negotiated, around which each member scores. The average of all scores allows for a ranking of applicants and the top scoring applications are funded.\nRATING\nReviewers will provide a rating of the application. This is a combined rating for all three adjudication criteria. Please ensure that you consider your assessment of all criteria in your rating.\nCriterion\nRating (1 to 49)\nSignificance and Impact of the Research (need for research, potential impact of the findings)\nApproaches and Methods (proposes a clear question with appropriately designed methods and analysis, with few limitations identified); originality, feasibility)\nExpertise, Experience and Resources (quality of applicant, research environment, research team)\nRank and Rating Scale Descriptor Range\nOutstanding 45.0-49.9\nExcellent 40.0-44.9\nVery good 35.0-39.9\nGood 30.0-34.9\nNeeds revision 25.0-29.9\nNeeds major revision 20.0-24.9\nSeriously flawed 10.0-19.9\nUnacceptable/ Rejected 00.0-9.9\nWritten Review\nProvide a critical assessment of the application by stating the strengths and weaknesses of the project, as well as constructive feedback based on the evaluation criteria described in the peer review manual.\nIntegration of Budget Assessment\nReviewers are asked to determine if the budget is appropriate as described in the application and if it is realistic and well-justified.\nCCS Award Assessment Criteria\nAssessment Criteria: All applications are reviewed by two peer-review committee members from the CCS research community and, whenever deemed appropriate by the Chair where additional expertise is required, a third reviewer. Scientific reviewers score the application based on the following criteria:\n1.\nSignificance and Impact of the Research:\nIs the study well justified? Are the preliminary data compelling? Is there a need for research? Is the potential impact of the findings important)\n2.\nApproaches and Methods:\napplicant proposes a clear question with appropriately designed methods and analysis, with few limitations identified; Is the study well outlined and reasonable for the timeline?; what is the originality? what is the feasibility?\n3.\nExpertise, Experience and Resources:\nWhat is the quality of applicant? appropriate team members included? Is suitable expertise available, particularly to support an early career researcher or a researcher branching to a new topic? Is the research environment supportive?\nScientific reviewers will also evaluate the proposed budget for appropriateness and feasibility. The expectation of the proposed budget is that it is fully justified and takes into consideration the needs of the research project and any anticipated changes in requirements over the term of the grant.\nPrior to the review committee meeting, reviewers will submit their scores to CCS via the on-line platform. Only applications competitive for funding will be discussed at the review committee meeting. After a detailed discussion, a consensus rating will be negotiated, around which each member scores. The average of all scores allows for a ranking of applicants, and the top scoring applications are funded.\nKnowledge Translation: CCS expects awardees to disseminate knowledge created from CCS funding to various users (e.g., the public, health-care practitioners, the media, scientists, and policy makers) and facilitate their translation into improved knowledge to support health, more effective products or services, and/or a strengthened healthcare system. In all knowledge translation activities, awardees must prominently acknowledge the support provided by CCS and refer to themselves as recipients of the 2024 CCS-PFIZER-CHF ALLIANCE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP AWARD IN FIRST NATIONS, INUIT AND MÉTIS\n(FNIM) COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCING HEART FUNCTION (HF) INEQUITIE.\nCCS Research and Fellowship Awards – Appendix A : Terms and Conditions",

CCS considers that a conflict of interest exists when the reviewers personal, professional or financial interests affect, or may be perceived to affect, their objectivity. Potential reviewers will recuse themselves from the review where a COI exists or may appear to exist. These policies have been developed by CCS to ensure the effective management of real or perceived conflicts of interest in the review process to ultimately encourage a culture of trust and transparency in the research funding process.\nReview of Applications\nScientific Review Committee\nThe Award review committees are volunteer committees. Each peer-review committee member has demonstrated scientific expertise in cardiovascular disease. Appointment of committee members takes into consideration required expertise, regional distribution, gender, and language skills to ensure a fair and balanced review process. Members are appointed for a three-year term. All recipients of CCS Awards are committed to serving at least a one-year term as a peer reviewer.\nAny reviewer who is a Co-Applicant or Collaborator on an CCS Award application may not be present when their application is being assessed and must recuse themselves from the discussion. Applications are reviewed by two committee members and, whenever deemed appropriate by the Co-Chairs, and an additional reader, when expertise is required. Each reviewer conducts a written review and rates the application based on the Peer-Review Criteria in Eligibility and Assessment Criteria. Scientific reviewers are assigned to applications based on their area of expertise, and with consideration of any real or perceived conflicts of interest. Prior to the committee meeting, reviewers will submit their scores to CCS via the on-line platform. After a panel discussion, a consensus rating will be negotiated, around which each member scores. The average of all scores allows for a ranking of applicants and the top scoring applications are funded.\nRATING\nReviewers will provide a rating of the application. This is a combined rating for all three adjudication criteria. Please ensure that you consider your assessment of all criteria in your rating.\nCriterion\nRating (1 to 49)\nSignificance and Impact of the Research (need for research, potential impact of the findings)\nApproaches and Methods (proposes a clear question with appropriately designed methods and analysis, with few limitations identified); originality, feasibility)\nExpertise, Experience and Resources (quality of applicant, research environment, research team)\nRank and Rating Scale Descriptor Range\nOutstanding 45.0-49.9\nExcellent 40.0-44.9\nVery good 35.0-39.9\nGood 30.0-34.9\nNeeds revision 25.0-29.9\nNeeds major revision 20.0-24.9\nSeriously flawed 10.0-19.9\nUnacceptable/ Rejected 00.0-9.9\nWritten Review\nProvide a critical assessment of the application by stating the strengths and weaknesses of the project, as well as constructive feedback based on the evaluation criteria described in the peer review manual.\nIntegration of Budget Assessment\nReviewers are asked to determine if the budget is appropriate as described in the application and if it is realistic and well-justified.\nCCS Award Assessment Criteria\nAssessment Criteria\n: All applications are reviewed by two peer-review committee members from the CCS research community and, whenever deemed appropriate by the Chair where additional expertise is required, a third reviewer. Scientific reviewers score the application based on the following criteria:\n1.\nSignificance and Impact of the Research:\nIs the study well justified? Are the preliminary data compelling? Is there a need for research? Is the potential impact of the findings important)\n2.\nApproaches and Methods:\napplicant proposes a clear question with appropriately designed methods and analysis, with few limitations identified; Is the study well outlined and reasonable for the timeline?; what is the originality? what is the feasibility?\n3.\nExpertise, Experience and Resources:\nWhat is the quality of applicant? appropriate team members included? Is suitable expertise available, particularly to support an early career researcher or a researcher branching to a new topic? Is the research environment supportive?\nScientific reviewers will also evaluate the proposed budget for appropriateness and feasibility. The expectation of the proposed budget is that it is fully justified and takes into consideration the needs of the research project and any anticipated changes in requirements over the term of the grant.\nPrior to the review committee meeting, reviewers will submit their scores to CCS via the on-line platform. Only applications competitive for funding will be discussed at the review committee meeting. After a detailed discussion, a consensus rating will be negotiated, around which each member scores. The average of all scores allows for a ranking of applicants, and the top scoring applications are funded.\nKnowledge Translation\n: CCS expects awardees to disseminate knowledge created from CCS funding to various users (e.g., the public, health-care practitioners, the media, scientists, and policy makers) and facilitate their translation into improved knowledge to support health, more effective products or services, and/or a strengthened healthcare system. In all knowledge translation activities, awardees must prominently acknowledge the support provided by CCS and refer to themselves as recipients of the CCS-Pfizer ATTR-CM Research Trainee Award .\nCCS Research and Fellowship Awards – Appendix A : Terms and Conditions",

Specifically, we are interested in looking at the spillover impact on cardiovascular care due to the COVID-19 pandemic public health countermeasures from March 2020, such as the slow-down of scheduled surgeries and procedures. Our goal is to reduce the cardiovascular health consequences of the current and subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing up-to-date data from across Canada to health care providers, administrators and policy makers. Data is provided by national (CIHI) and provincial data custodians and will be updated every three months. We have focused on the cardiovascular admissions and procedures, reported per week, also reported at national and provincial (where possible) levels. To understand the severity of the cases, we also report the average length of stay per admission/procedure/week and the mean deaths/100 cases. The outcomes are reported only at a national level.\nInterpretation\nFrom March 2020, there was a substantial reduction in all CV procedures and admissions. There is no signal on the current data that outcomes were worse for the admissions and procedures performed. We anticipate having patient wait-list data soon.\nData is updated as new “open data” is available from CIHI and other jurisdictional data sources. The open data will be updated every 3 months and may reflect under-reporting from individual institutions.\nAll counts with < 5 people is suppressed as per privacy regulations.\nCOVID-19 statistics are provided by Johns Hopkins University.

CCS considers that a conflict of interest exists when the reviewers personal, professional or financial interests affect, or may be perceived to affect, their objectivity. Potential reviewers will recuse themselves from the review where a COI exists or may appear to exist. These policies have been developed by CCS to ensure the effective management of real or perceived conflicts of interest in the review process to ultimately encourage a culture of trust and transparency in the research funding process.\nReview of Applications\nScientific Review Committee\nThe Award review committees are volunteer committees. Each peer-review committee member has demonstrated scientific expertise in cardiovascular disease. Appointment of committee members takes into consideration required expertise, regional distribution, gender, and language skills to ensure a fair and balanced review process. Members are appointed for a three-year term. All recipients of CCS Awards are committed to serving at least a one-year term as a peer reviewer.\nAny reviewer who is a Co-Applicant or Collaborator on an CCS Award application may not be present when their application is being assessed and must recuse themselves from the discussion. Applications are reviewed by two committee members and, whenever deemed appropriate by the Co-Chairs, and an additional reader, when expertise is required. Each reviewer conducts a written review and rates the application based on the Peer-Review Criteria in Eligibility and Assessment Criteria. Scientific reviewers are assigned to applications based on their area of expertise, and with consideration of any real or perceived conflicts of interest. Prior to the committee meeting, reviewers will submit their scores to CCS via the on-line platform. After a panel discussion, a consensus rating will be negotiated, around which each member scores. The average of all scores allows for a ranking of applicants and the top scoring applications are funded.\nRATING\nReviewers will provide a rating of the application. This is a combined rating for all three adjudication criteria. Please ensure that you consider your assessment of all criteria in your rating.\nCriterion\nRating (1 to 49)\nSignificance and Impact of the Research (need for research, potential impact of the findings)\nApproaches and Methods (proposes a clear question with appropriately designed methods and analysis, with few limitations identified); originality, feasibility)\nExpertise, Experience and Resources (quality of applicant, research environment, research team)\nRank and Rating Scale Descriptor Range\nOutstanding 45.0-49.9\nExcellent 40.0-44.9\nVery good 35.0-39.9\nGood 30.0-34.9\nNeeds revision 25.0-29.9\nNeeds major revision 20.0-24.9\nSeriously flawed 10.0-19.9\nUnacceptable/ Rejected 00.0-9.9\nWritten Review\nProvide a critical assessment of the application by stating the strengths and weaknesses of the project, as well as constructive feedback based on the evaluation criteria described in the peer review manual.\nIntegration of Budget Assessment\nReviewers are asked to determine if the budget is appropriate as described in the application and if it is realistic and well-justified.\nCCS Award Assessment Criteria\nAssessment Criteria: All applications are reviewed by two peer-review committee members from the CCS research community and, whenever deemed appropriate by the Chair where additional expertise is required, a third reviewer. Scientific reviewers score the application based on the following criteria:\n1.\nSignificance and Impact of the Research:\nIs the study well justified? Are the preliminary data compelling? Is there a need for research? Is the potential impact of the findings important)\n2.\nApproaches and Methods:\napplicant proposes a clear question with appropriately designed methods and analysis, with few limitations identified; Is the study well outlined and reasonable for the timeline?; what is the originality? what is the feasibility?\n3.\nExpertise, Experience and Resources:\nWhat is the quality of applicant? appropriate team members included? Is suitable expertise available, particularly to support an early career researcher or a researcher branching to a new topic? Is the research environment supportive?\nScientific reviewers will also evaluate the proposed budget for appropriateness and feasibility. The expectation of the proposed budget is that it is fully justified and takes into consideration the needs of the research project and any anticipated changes in requirements over the term of the grant.\nPrior to the review committee meeting, reviewers will submit their scores to CCS via the on-line platform. Only applications competitive for funding will be discussed at the review committee meeting. After a detailed discussion, a consensus rating will be negotiated, around which each member scores. The average of all scores allows for a ranking of applicants, and the top scoring applications are funded.\nKnowledge Translation: CCS expects awardees to disseminate knowledge created from CCS funding to various users (e.g., the public, health-care practitioners, the media, scientists, and policy makers) and facilitate their translation into improved knowledge to support health, more effective products or services, and/or a strengthened healthcare system. In all knowledge translation activities, awardees must prominently acknowledge the support provided by CCS and refer to themselves as recipients of the 2024 CCS-PFIZER-CHF ALLIANCE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP AWARD IN FIRST NATIONS, INUIT AND MÉTIS\n(FNIM) COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCING HEART FUNCTION (HF) INEQUITIE.\nCCS Research and Fellowship Awards – Appendix A : Terms and Conditions",

CCS considers that a conflict of interest exists when the reviewers personal, professional or financial interests affect, or may be perceived to affect, their objectivity. Potential reviewers will recuse themselves from the review where a COI exists or may appear to exist. These policies have been developed by CCS to ensure the effective management of real or perceived conflicts of interest in the review process to ultimately encourage a culture of trust and transparency in the research funding process.\nReview of Applications\nScientific Review Committee\nThe Award review committees are volunteer committees. Each peer-review committee member has demonstrated scientific expertise in cardiovascular disease. Appointment of committee members takes into consideration required expertise, regional distribution, gender, and language skills to ensure a fair and balanced review process. Members are appointed for a three-year term. All recipients of CCS Awards are committed to serving at least a one-year term as a peer reviewer.\nAny reviewer who is a Co-Applicant or Collaborator on an CCS Award application may not be present when their application is being assessed and must recuse themselves from the discussion. Applications are reviewed by two committee members and, whenever deemed appropriate by the Co-Chairs, and an additional reader, when expertise is required. Each reviewer conducts a written review and rates the application based on the Peer-Review Criteria in Eligibility and Assessment Criteria. Scientific reviewers are assigned to applications based on their area of expertise, and with consideration of any real or perceived conflicts of interest. Prior to the committee meeting, reviewers will submit their scores to CCS via the on-line platform. After a panel discussion, a consensus rating will be negotiated, around which each member scores. The average of all scores allows for a ranking of applicants and the top scoring applications are funded.\nRATING\nReviewers will provide a rating of the application. This is a combined rating for all three adjudication criteria. Please ensure that you consider your assessment of all criteria in your rating.\nCriterion\nRating (1 to 49)\nSignificance and Impact of the Research (need for research, potential impact of the findings)\nApproaches and Methods (proposes a clear question with appropriately designed methods and analysis, with few limitations identified); originality, feasibility)\nExpertise, Experience and Resources (quality of applicant, research environment, research team)\nRank and Rating Scale Descriptor Range\nOutstanding 45.0-49.9\nExcellent 40.0-44.9\nVery good 35.0-39.9\nGood 30.0-34.9\nNeeds revision 25.0-29.9\nNeeds major revision 20.0-24.9\nSeriously flawed 10.0-19.9\nUnacceptable/ Rejected 00.0-9.9\nWritten Review\nProvide a critical assessment of the application by stating the strengths and weaknesses of the project, as well as constructive feedback based on the evaluation criteria described in the peer review manual.\nIntegration of Budget Assessment\nReviewers are asked to determine if the budget is appropriate as described in the application and if it is realistic and well-justified.\nCCS Award Assessment Criteria\nAssessment Criteria\n: All applications are reviewed by two peer-review committee members from the CCS research community and, whenever deemed appropriate by the Chair where additional expertise is required, a third reviewer. Scientific reviewers score the application based on the following criteria:\n1.\nSignificance and Impact of the Research:\nIs the study well justified? Are the preliminary data compelling? Is there a need for research? Is the potential impact of the findings important)\n2.\nApproaches and Methods:\napplicant proposes a clear question with appropriately designed methods and analysis, with few limitations identified; Is the study well outlined and reasonable for the timeline?; what is the originality? what is the feasibility?\n3.\nExpertise, Experience and Resources:\nWhat is the quality of applicant? appropriate team members included? Is suitable expertise available, particularly to support an early career researcher or a researcher branching to a new topic? Is the research environment supportive?\nScientific reviewers will also evaluate the proposed budget for appropriateness and feasibility. The expectation of the proposed budget is that it is fully justified and takes into consideration the needs of the research project and any anticipated changes in requirements over the term of the grant.\nPrior to the review committee meeting, reviewers will submit their scores to CCS via the on-line platform. Only applications competitive for funding will be discussed at the review committee meeting. After a detailed discussion, a consensus rating will be negotiated, around which each member scores. The average of all scores allows for a ranking of applicants, and the top scoring applications are funded.\nKnowledge Translation\n: CCS expects awardees to disseminate knowledge created from CCS funding to various users (e.g., the public, health-care practitioners, the media, scientists, and policy makers) and facilitate their translation into improved knowledge to support health, more effective products or services, and/or a strengthened healthcare system. In all knowledge translation activities, awardees must prominently acknowledge the support provided by CCS and refer to themselves as recipients of the CCS-Pfizer ATTR-CM Research Trainee Award .\nCCS Research and Fellowship Awards – Appendix A : Terms and Conditions",

Specifically, we are interested in looking at the spillover impact on cardiovascular care due to the COVID-19 pandemic public health countermeasures from March 2020, such as the slow-down of scheduled surgeries and procedures. Our goal is to reduce the cardiovascular health consequences of the current and subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing up-to-date data from across Canada to health care providers, administrators and policy makers. Data is provided by national (CIHI) and provincial data custodians and will be updated every three months. We have focused on the cardiovascular admissions and procedures, reported per week, also reported at national and provincial (where possible) levels. To understand the severity of the cases, we also report the average length of stay per admission/procedure/week and the mean deaths/100 cases. The outcomes are reported only at a national level.\nInterpretation\nFrom March 2020, there was a substantial reduction in all CV procedures and admissions. There is no signal on the current data that outcomes were worse for the admissions and procedures performed. We anticipate having patient wait-list data soon.\nData is updated as new “open data” is available from CIHI and other jurisdictional data sources. The open data will be updated every 3 months and may reflect under-reporting from individual institutions.\nAll counts with < 5 people is suppressed as per privacy regulations.\nCOVID-19 statistics are provided by Johns Hopkins University.

Funded research must be completed within 12 months from the start of funding.\nStart your Submission\nAward Handbook\nPast Award Recipients\nEligibility\nApplicants must be or become members of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society before accepting the award. For more information about CCS Membership, visit the\nCCS Membership Page\n.\n*You must be a CCS member to accept funding, but you can apply without being a member!\nThe principal investigator must be an early career researcher (ECR). An early career researcher (ECR) is a researcher within five years of the date of their first independent research-related appointment at an academic institution. Given that career progress for an ECR is particularly vulnerable to normal life circumstances, CCS will adjust the eligibility window, as per CIHR applications, as follows:\nEligible leaves (e.g., maternity, parental, medical, family medical, bereavement) will extend ECR status (i.e., will not be counted towards the maximum) and are credited as twice the amount of time taken.\nNo adjustments are provided for professional leaves (e.g., training, sabbatical, administrative). No adjustments are provided for time spent on non-research-related duties or for the pursuit of non-research-related career activities.\nApplicants must be a Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident of Canada at the time of receiving funding.\nCo-applicants of different career stages can be included.\nApplicants can be principal investigators on only one application per cycle.\nAward funds are solely intended for research performed in Canada.\nThe award and funds are intended for original research and should not supplement funding for that already have extramural funding.\nIf the submission refers to a multicenter clinical trial, the applicant must specify their specific role in the research study.\nIf the application is for a sub-study of an ongoing project or trial, the applicant must specify their role and explain how the sub-study is distinct from the main study.\nFunded research must be completed within 48 months from the start of funding.\nThe Award\nOne (1) award is available in 2025.\nAward:\n$35,000\nFunds will be administered by the Cardiology Division of the awardee’s affiliated university or equivalent.\nThe Peer Review Process and Evaluation Committee\nAll applications will be pre-screened for eligibility. Applications that are late, incomplete and/or do not meet the basic eligibility criteria will not be considered for review. Peer review of all eligible applications will be conducted by a scientific review committee comprised of CCS members. All eligible proposals will be reviewed by at least two members of the peer review committee.\nIf you have any questions or require support preparing and submitting your application, please email\nresearchawards@ccs.ca\n.\nIf you have any questions or require support preparing or submitting your application, please email\nresearchawards@ccs.ca\n.\nSupported by:\nThe Canadian Cardiovascular Society and Novo Nordisk are proud to support the CCS-Novo Nordisk Cardiometabolic Research Award.

Specifically, we are interested in looking at the spillover impact on cardiovascular care due to the COVID-19 pandemic public health countermeasures from March 2020, such as the slow-down of scheduled surgeries and procedures. Our goal is to reduce the cardiovascular health consequences of the current and subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing up-to-date data from across Canada to health care providers, administrators and policy makers. Data is provided by national (CIHI) and provincial data custodians and will be updated every three months. We have focused on the cardiovascular admissions and procedures, reported per week, also reported at national and provincial (where possible) levels. To understand the severity of the cases, we also report the average length of stay per admission/procedure/week and the mean deaths/100 cases. The outcomes are reported only at a national level.\nInterpretation\nFrom March 2020, there was a substantial reduction in all CV procedures and admissions. There is no signal on the current data that outcomes were worse for the admissions and procedures performed. We anticipate having patient wait-list data soon.\nData is updated as new “open data” is available from CIHI and other jurisdictional data sources. The open data will be updated every 3 months and may reflect under-reporting from individual institutions.\nAll counts with < 5 people is suppressed as per privacy regulations.\nCOVID-19 statistics are provided by Johns Hopkins University.

Specifically, we are interested in looking at the spillover impact on cardiovascular care due to the COVID-19 pandemic public health countermeasures from March 2020, such as the slow-down of scheduled surgeries and procedures. Our goal is to reduce the cardiovascular health consequences of the current and subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing up-to-date data from across Canada to health care providers, administrators and policy makers. Data is provided by national (CIHI) and provincial data custodians and will be updated every three months. We have focused on the cardiovascular admissions and procedures, reported per week, also reported at national and provincial (where possible) levels. To understand the severity of the cases, we also report the average length of stay per admission/procedure/week and the mean deaths/100 cases. The outcomes are reported only at a national level.\nInterpretation\nFrom March 2020, there was a substantial reduction in all CV procedures and admissions.
