CCS COVID-19 Challenge for Canada Initiative (CCS-C3I)
CCS COVID-19 Challenge for Canada Initiative (CCS-C3I)
The Award
The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting millions world-wide with over 40,000 Canadians affected. The prevalence and outcomes of cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 are poorly understood and remain uncharacterized.
The aim of this initiative is to empower the CCS clinician-scientist community to be prepared to harness emerging large-scale funds. By fostering multisite cardiovascular research across Canada, our CV community will be at the forefront of readiness for large-scale, CVD-related COVID-19 disease initiatives. This effort will inform health policy in Canada relative to health services delivery for CV patients in this time of crisis.
